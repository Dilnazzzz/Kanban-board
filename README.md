# Welcome to your Kanban Board!

This is a basic task management tool where users can add new tasks to TO DO Column and slide them to the right as they start working on the task and complete it. 

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: Website description and how it was made

← `index.html`: The structure and content of the page. It has headings, columns, and buttons. 

← `style.css`: Styling rules to the website content, such as background gradient, font size, margins, and paddings. 

← `script.js`: The code runs when the page loads and when users click one of the two buttons around the task. 

## How does the website work? 

1. Add a task in the form below the headings and submit it with Enter. The form accepts text of different lengths and content. The task automatically appears under the TO DO column. There are two buttons around it. 
2. Click the transparent button on the left of the task to change the status of the task from TO TO to DOING. Once clicked, the task disappears from the first column and moves to the second. 
3. Click the same button again to see the task moving to the DONE column. If pressed again, the task is deleted.
4. Click the red x button to delete the task at any point. 

## Interesting features of the website

1. The website has a history of tasks in JSON. Once the website is reloaded, users can still see their previous tasks.
